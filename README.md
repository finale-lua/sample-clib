# sample-clib
Sample C library that can be loaded by Lua on Finale (_RGP Lua_ plugin).

If you wish to write your own C library that can be loaded into lua scripts running under _RGP Lua_, you can use the build files (and sample source code) as a template. You can similarly use it to build existing libraries from source code.
